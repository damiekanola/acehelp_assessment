# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Instructions to run the project locally
Prerequisites

Step 1: Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- Git
- Visual Studio Code(optional)

Step 2: Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository by running this code in your terminal

    git clone https://github.com/damiekanola/acehelp_assessment

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

    cd your-repo (cd acehelp_assessment)

3. Install all dependencies by running this code

The project will be running at: http://localhost:5173/ (this is the default Vite port). Proceed to access it in your browser

If given more time, I would implement the following improvements:

- Enhanced UI/UX – Improve the overall design to ensure better responsiveness, accessibility, and a more seamless user experience.
- Dark Mode Support – Add a dark mode toggle to enhance usability and provide a more comfortable viewing experience.
- Pagination Improvement – Implement infinite scrolling or a more dynamic pagination system for smoother navigation.
- Better Error Handling & Loading States – Introduce skeleton loaders for a more polished look and improve error handling to enhance user feedback.
